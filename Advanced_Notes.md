### Advanced Notes on Time Complexity

#### **1. Introduction to Time Complexity**
Time complexity is a critical aspect of algorithm analysis, describing how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. A deep understanding of time complexity involves not just recognizing common patterns, but also mastering the theoretical foundations and advanced concepts.

#### **2. Big O Notation and Asymptotic Analysis**
**Big O Notation**: Describes the upper bound of the time complexity, representing the worst-case scenario.
- **Formal Definition**: A function \( T(n) \) is \( O(f(n)) \) if there exist positive constants \( c \) and \( n_0 \) such that for all \( n \geq n_0 \), \( T(n) \leq c \cdot f(n) \).

**Other Asymptotic Notations**:
- **Big Ω (Omega) Notation**: Describes the lower bound.
  - \( T(n) \) is \( \Omega(f(n)) \) if there exist positive constants \( c \) and \( n_0 \) such that for all \( n \geq n_0 \), \( T(n) \geq c \cdot f(n) \).
- **Big Θ (Theta) Notation**: Describes the tight bound.
  - \( T(n) \) is \( \Theta(f(n)) \) if there exist positive constants \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( n_0 \) such that for all \( n \geq n_0 \), \( c_1 \cdot f(n) \leq T(n) \leq c_2 \cdot f(n) \).

#### **3. Common Time Complexities**
- **Constant Time**: \( O(1) \)
- **Logarithmic Time**: \( O(\log n) \)
- **Linear Time**: \( O(n) \)
- **Linearithmic Time**: \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Quadratic Time**: \( O(n^2) \)
- **Cubic Time**: \( O(n^3) \)
- **Exponential Time**: \( O(2^n) \)
- **Factorial Time**: \( O(n!) \)

#### **4. Detailed Examples and Analysis**

**Example 1: Constant Time Complexity (O(1))**
- **Scenario**: Accessing a single element in an array.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def get_first_element(arr):
      return arr[0]
  ```

**Example 2: Logarithmic Time Complexity (O(log n))**
- **Scenario**: Binary search in a sorted array.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr, target):
      low = 0
      high = len(arr) - 1
      while low <= high:
          mid = (low + high) // 2
          if arr[mid] == target:
              return mid
          elif arr[mid] < target:
              low = mid + 1
          else:
              high = mid - 1
      return -1
  ```

**Example 3: Linear Time Complexity (O(n))**
- **Scenario**: Iterating through an array.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def print_elements(arr):
      for element in arr:
          print(element)
  ```

**Example 4: Linearithmic Time Complexity (O(n log n))**
- **Scenario**: Merge sort algorithm.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def merge_sort(arr):
      if len(arr) <= 1:
          return arr
      mid = len(arr) // 2
      left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
      right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
      return merge(left, right)

  def merge(left, right):
      result = []
      while left and right:
          if left[0] < right[0]:
              result.append(left.pop(0))
          else:
              result.append(right.pop(0))
      result.extend(left if left else right)
      return result
  ```

**Example 5: Quadratic Time Complexity (O(n^2))**
- **Scenario**: Bubble sort algorithm.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
  ```

**Example 6: Exponential Time Complexity (O(2^n))**
- **Scenario**: Recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def fibonacci(n):
      if n <= 1:
          return n
      else:
          return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
  ```

#### **5. Amortized Analysis**
Amortized analysis provides an average time per operation over a sequence of operations, ensuring that the average performance is acceptable even if some operations are expensive.

**Example: Dynamic Array Resizing**
- **Scenario**: Doubling the size of an array when it becomes full.
- **Analysis**:
  - Single insertion: O(1) on average.
  - Doubling occurs every \( n \) operations, leading to an amortized cost of O(1) per insertion.

#### **6. Advanced Topics in Time Complexity**

**1. Master Theorem**
- Used for solving recurrence relations of the form \( T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) \).
- Provides a straightforward way to determine the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

**2. Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms**
- Analyzing algorithms with probabilistic inputs or random choices.
- Example: QuickSort with random pivot selection has expected time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \).

**3. Complexity Classes**
- **P**: Problems solvable in polynomial time.
- **NP**: Problems verifiable in polynomial time.
- **NP-Complete**: Hardest problems in NP, if one NP-complete problem is solved in polynomial time, all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time.
- **NP-Hard**: At least as hard as NP-complete problems, but not necessarily in NP.

#### **7. Practical Applications**
**Algorithm Optimization**: Identifying bottlenecks and improving the efficiency of algorithms.
**Comparative Analysis**: Choosing the best algorithm based on time complexity for specific problem sizes and constraints.
**Real-World Examples**:
- Sorting large datasets: Use \( O(n \log n) \) algorithms like Merge Sort or QuickSort.
- Searching in databases: Use \( O(\log n) \) algorithms like Binary Search on indexed data.
